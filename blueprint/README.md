# Beaver IoT Blueprint Repository

Welcome to the Beaver IoT Blueprint Repository.

This repository provides essential blueprint resources for [Beaver IoT](https://github.com/Milesight-IoT/beaver-iot). It contains two main types of blueprints:

## 1. Device Model Blueprints

Device Model Blueprints include:
- **Device Definition**: Device templates that specify the properties and capabilities of each device model.
- **Codec Scripts**: Encoding and decoding scripts for device data.
- **Device Blueprint Files**: Blueprint files that define device-specific workflows and canvases.

With blueprint files, you can customize the initial workflows and device canvases associated with each device upon creation. This enriches the initial device information and showcases the key features of every device model.

## 2. Solution Blueprints

Solution Blueprints provide comprehensive templates for end-to-end IoT solutions, integrating multiple device models and workflows to address specific business scenarios.
