## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

- Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/rifatsekerariot/beaver-iot-integrations/security/advisories/new) (recommended), or
- Open a **private** security advisory so we can discuss and fix the issue before disclosure.

We will acknowledge your report and work on a fix. Thank you for helping keep Beaver IoT Integrations secure.
